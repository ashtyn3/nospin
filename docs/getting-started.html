                    <p>
                        <b>
                            Thank you for reading the docs! It takes so long to
                            write this so thank you for taking the time to read
                            it.
                        </b>
                        Qoute is a simple filesystem designed to make the cloud
                        more accessible. Qoute allows you to synchronize all of
                        your devices file systems into one. Here is an example:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lets say Marvin has a computer for work and a computer
                        for home as a lot people do. Well one day Marvin forgot
                        his work computer at work (Ooh No). With Qoute All
                        Marvin has to do is open his home computers terminal and
                        grab all files he needs from Qoute to continue his work
                        from home.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="Usage">Qoute usage</h2>
                    <p>
                        So far Qoute has your basic options for any filesystem,
                        read, write, and delete. To get started using Qoute
                        first install the latest version from the github
                        releases. Once you downloaded the zip file that should
                        have a name that looks similar to
                        <i>Qoute-1.1.0.zip</i>. Extract that file and install
                        the binary file to your computer currently Qoute only
                        supports Mac and Unix based operating systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>To make sure Qoute is working on your computer run:</p>

                    <pre><code class="bash">Qoute</code></pre>
                    <p>It should return something that looks like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="bash">Usage:
Qoute COMMAND
commands:
    -auth string                   Generates user with passed in email.
    -put, -p string [-o string]    Put file with path of -o option or with passed in path.
    -get, -g string                Get file with path.
    -del, -D string                Delete file with path.
    -user, -u                      Prints information about current user.
</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Before you start uploading stuff you will need to
                        register a user. You can do this with the following:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="bash">Qoute -auth marvin@example.com</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        General rule of thumb is when making a Qoute user always
                        use your primary email address as the username. The auth
                        command will return your public key and your email.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To test to make sure the user was created successfully
                        you can run:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="bash">Qoute -user</code></pre>
                    <p>This should return your public key and email.</p>
                    <h3 id="file-methods">File methods</h3>
                    <p>
                        Qoute works off tries to duplicate your original file
                        structure across all the cloud. So when uploading a file
                        pass in a relative file path and Qoute will use that
                        path as the path to the file.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <p>Lets say you have the following directory structure:</p>
                    <pre><code class="bash">example_dir
├── Documents
│  └── Essay.txt
└─── Pictures
   └── family_christmas_2019.jpeg
</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Lets say you want to upload Essay.txt to Qoute and your
                        currently in the example_dir directory. Well all you
                        have to do is:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="bash">Qoute -put marvin@example.com/Documents/Essay.txt</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This will upload the file to Qoute with the name
                        <i>Documents/Essay.txt</i>. If you wanted to do a custom
                        file name for when its uploaded just include a -o flag.
                        For example you can do:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="bash">Qoute -put marvin@example.com/Documents/Essay.txt -o essay.md</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This will upload the file <i>Documents/Essay.txt</i> as
                        <i>essay.md</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To get a file you can just do that same thing as put
                        except with -get.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="bash">Qoute -get marvin@example.com/essay.md</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The get method will print out the contents of that file
                        to the console. If you don't want this to happen and
                        instead you want to write the contents to a file just do
                        the following:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="bash">Qoute -get marvin@example.com/essay.md > newFile.md</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This will write the contents of the <i>essay.md</i> in
                        Qoute to the file <i>newFile.md</i> on your local
                        computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can also get a folder with the following.</p>
                    <pre><code class="bash">Qoute -get marvin@example.com/someFolder/</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This will return the names of the files in the folder
                        <i>someFolder</i> on Qoute.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To delete a file is really simple all you have to know
                        is the name of the file you want to delete.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="bash">Qoute -del marvin@example.com/essay.md</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This will delete the file at the path specified on
                        Qoute.
                    </p>
